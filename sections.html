  <p>This page shares my best articles to read on topics like
    health, happiness, creativity, productivity and more.
     The central question that drives my work is,
     “How can we live better?” To answer that question,
      I like to write about science-based ways to solve
      practical problems.</p>

    Let's define behavioral psychology.
     Behavioral psychology is the study of the connection
     between our minds and our behavior.
      Sometimes you will hear behavioral
      psychology referred to as behaviorism.
       The researchers and scientists who study behavioral
        psychology are trying to understand why we behave
        the way we do and they are concerned with discovering
         patterns in our actions and behaviors. The hope is
         that if we can use behavioral psychology to help us
         predict how humans will behave, we can build better
         habits as individuals, create better products as companies,
          and develop better living spaces as communities.
